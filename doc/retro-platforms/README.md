varlpenis (un)support for retro platforms
=========================================

Note that none of the tutorials in this folder are *technically* supported.
That is, if something goes wrong while compiling for your Altair 8800,
I'm not obligated to help you.
(That's not saying I won't become interested and work on it anyway.)
